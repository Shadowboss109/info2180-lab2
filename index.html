                        Like frugal blogs, making money related
                         blogs have become insanely popular since 
                         the global economy has declined in recent years. 
                         The want for making more money in order to have a “Ok” quality of life,
                          is increasing year on year. Wages are not rising, jobs are becoming less secure 
                          and the cost of living is constantly rising. This is why sites like the ones below in this section are 
                        becoming more and more popular.</p>

                    <p>Again, if you come at this niche with a different angle, 
                        then potentially you can have a great and 
                        successful website on your hands.</p>

                    <h2>Miss Thrifty</h2>
                    <p class="Date">March 18,2012 by Maria Cornwell</p>
                    <p>One of the more popular frugal blogs in the UK, Miss Thrifty 
                        is targeting young mums with her money saving, frugal tips and 
                        articles. And rightly so! The market is massive and she’s meeting a need for this type of information. Young mums aren’t exactly rolling in cash. They may have had to give up work and are now relying on just one wage coming in,
                         so the need to be more frugal with everyday living is a must.</p>
                         
                    <p><img class="pic1" src="pic1.jpeg" alt="" width="150px" height="150px">The great thing about this blog is the conversational tone and 
                        the real person behind the brand. I think it’s inspiring to other 
                        mums to see someone like them making such a difference in other people’s 
                        lives by creating amazingly useful content that is 100% actionable.
                         Also it may inspire mums to set up their own blog and to write about
                          their experiences as a mother and a wife in the 21st century.
